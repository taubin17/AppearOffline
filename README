This project is an attempt to group online services together, and manage your online status in said services.
Ideally, game platforms like BattleNet (In progress), Steam, and Discord (Maybe more in the future, such as Origin), as well as social media like Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat (The snap map).
For all of the applications listed above, the project serves as a method to turn multiple or all methods offline or online. This is a great feature, but is extremely difficult to implement as each application is built different and possess different levels of security.
If you have any recommendations for applications to apply to this repository, feel free to email me @ taubin17@gmail.com.
